# EasyPolyMap

This is a Low Poly Map auto creation tool based on the simple lines and points you draw. It is very easy to use and enables you to custom your own Low Poly Terrain within 2 minutes!

The idea came out when I want to build a low poly game but lack of terrain composer to use. I don't want the terrain totally random,  and the terrain generated should be mobile friendly. So I create my own. All source code is free to use or change. Your improvement are very very welcome!

Special thanks to authors of all the open-source code I used in my project.

I'm now looking for jobs in USA, if you interest my work, Please give me a refer : )

Any Questions, feel free to give me an email zpt0219@gmail.com
